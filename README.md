Flap Flap Revolution = Flappy Bird + Dance Dance Revolution

Requirement: a working mic and Unity

The height of the bird is controlled by voice input and the objective of the game to get the highest score by running into the incoming beats while staying airborne.

The beats data was extracted from the song using Fourier transform in another software. In order to switch songs, it's required to get a .txt file of the beats(seconds into the song) and place it under the asset folder.
